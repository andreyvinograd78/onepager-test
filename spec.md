## 4) Visual & Interaction Spec (Plain Language)

### Layout & spacing philosophy

* Use generous whitespace and strict alignment to feel “expensive.”
* Keep max reading width narrow enough to feel editorial (not stretched).
* Use consistent vertical rhythm: clear section spacing; no crowded stacks.

### Typography feel

* A refined, modern typographic system with:

  * Large, calm headline for the name (not shouty).
  * Crisp body text with high readability.
  * Subtle hierarchy: meta line < body < headings < name.

### Color palette

* Background: warm off-white/ivory (light premium, not sterile).
* Text: deep charcoal (not pure black).
* Accent: a single muted accent used only for links/CTA focus states.

### Button and link behavior

* Primary CTA button: quiet, confident shape; strong contrast against the light background.
* Links: understated by default; become clearer on hover (underline or subtle tint shift).
* Ensure the LinkedIn CTA is always easy to find within the first screen.

### Motion principles (smooth, minimal)

* Page load: gentle fade/raise of hero content (very subtle).
* Scroll: soft reveal for section headings and role cards (no dramatic animations).
* Hover: micro-interactions only (slight elevation or underline reveal).
* Scrolling should feel smooth and controlled (no parallax-heavy effects).

### Mobile behavior

* Single-column layout; preserve whitespace (avoid cramming).
* Hero CTA remains prominent; links remain easily tappable.
* Cards become stacked blocks with the same hierarchy and spacing.

## 5) Acceptance Checklist (Testable)

* **Premium look:** Page feels calm, minimal, and “expensive” through spacing and typography—no visual clutter.
* **Clarity in 10 seconds:** Visitor can understand who Andrey is and what he does within the first screen. 
* **CTA discoverability:** “Connect on LinkedIn” appears in the hero and in the contact section. 
* **Factual integrity:** Every claim on the page is directly supported by the CV; nothing extra is implied.
* **Privacy respected:** No email/phone/DOB/address or other sensitive identifiers appear (unless explicitly added from an approved source).
* **Responsive:** Looks polished on mobile and desktop; no awkward line breaks or cramped sections.
* **Smoothness:** Scroll and hover interactions feel subtle and intentional (no jank, no over-animation).
* **No placeholders:** No “lorem ipsum,” empty icons, or dead links.

## 6) TBD / Needed From You (Only if you want them)

* Confirm whether you want to add an **email address** as a secondary contact path (not present in CV → would otherwise remain omitted).
* Confirm if you want any additional links (e.g., other profiles) — only if you provide them as approved content.
* Optional: preferred spelling/format for name in the hero (e.g., “Andrey Vinograd” vs “Andrey V.”) — default is exactly as CV.
